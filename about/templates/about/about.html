                With CTrack, you can: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Track your daily progress:</strong> Log completed jobs and instantly see how many credits you’ve earned for the day.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay aligned with your targets:</strong> Each day comes with a clear, adjusted target that takes into account your scheduled hours and any recorded absences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect your time off:</strong> Your rostered days off are built right into the system, so you only focus on the days that matter.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand your week at a glance:</strong> Visualize your targets, credits, and absences for the entire week, helping you plan better and stay motivated.</li>
                </ul>
                Our goal is to make work tracking straightforward — no more spreadsheets, no more guesswork. Just a clean view of your schedule, your targets, and your progress. <br>
                Whether you’re reviewing your performance or planning ahead, CTrack gives you the clarity you need to balance productivity with rest.
